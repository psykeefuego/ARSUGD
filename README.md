### Accomodation Recommendation System using Geolocational Data 🏠
#
Help students or working professionals find the best areas to look for accomodation, using this python-based stremlit application.
#
This project makes use of unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify different areas of a city into 3 categories:

🟢 Good to rent

🟡 Average

🔴 Not recommended for renting

The parameters used to classify the areas include average temperature, propensity to flooding, security, connectivity, bachelor/family friendly etc.
#
The results are displayed on a Folium graph. See the deployment here: https://accomodationbasedongeolocation.streamlit.app/
